# oryks-dog - A quadruped for Developing and Testing Navigation and Perception Algorithms.
![oryks-dog](https://github.com/lyleokoth/oryks-dog/blob/main/resources/notspot_render_new1)

This repository contains all the files and code needed to simulate the oryk-dog, a quadruped robot, using [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/)  and [ROS](https://www.ros.org/).
The software runs on [ROS noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic) and [Ubuntu 20.04](http://www.releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/). If you want to use a different ROS version, you might have to do some changes to the source code.

## The Motivation

The aim is to come up with a very simple, cheap and easy to assemble quadruped that can be used to rapidly develop and test navigation and perception algorithms. The available models in the market are rather expensive and getting a hold of one can be challenging (importation fees). This quadruped is easy to make: it's 3-d printable and very easy to assemble.
